CONCRETE
- [firefox]: "Save password?" is annoying -> remove through settings
- [fish]: display indicators for SSH login as soon as I setup servers
- [impermanence]: I never used the 30 days root backup; get rid of it (maybe keey only last root?)
- [polybar]: add battery indicators
- [i3]: pull multi-monitor stuff into main module and add dmenu selector
- [i3]: add option that lets other modules add keybindings (particularly )
- [dotfiles]: add devShell with makefile for common operations like `make this`, `make [ssh host]`, make [ssh host complete reinstall]
- [vscode]: add package with basic config for nix development
- [impermanence]: add nix expression that shows me the tree of dirs and files in the /persist volume. 
  As I'm experimenting I find that it's cluttering up so a quick visual diff would be nice to show me
  what's not needed anymore

CONCEPTUAL
- I'd like a way to integrate the disko layouts very tightly into the main config;
  for instance, impermenance requires a very specific layout and I want it to be secured without 
  actually writing it; possible options:
  - `config.bootDrive = { impermanence; encrypted; }`
  - `config.extraDrives = { [zfsPool ...] [simpleDrive ...] }`
- maybe it would be nice to have an imperative way to do some post-config. modules that need
  it could simply add script parts which a module would accumulate and put into nix store.
  possible use cases:
  - restore ssh key from melt seed phrase using bitwarden just using own hostname
  - fetch my rclone config for the various modules that need cloud sync
  - execute commands that enroll keys into the TPM automatically
